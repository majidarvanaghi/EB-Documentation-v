## Class 1: Explosives


### Subclass 1.1: Explosives

Consists of explosives that have a mass explosion hazard. A mass explosion is one which affects almost the entire load instantaneously.

### Subclass 1.2: Explosives

Consists of explosives that have a projection hazard but not a mass explosion hazard.

### Subclass 1.3: Explosives

Consists of explosives that have a projection hazard but not a mass explosion hazard.

### Subclass 1.4: Explosives

Consists of explosives that present a minor explosion hazard. The explosive effects are largely confined to the package and no projection of fragments of appreciable size or range is to be expected. An external fire must not cause virtually instantaneous explosion of almost the entire contents of the package.

### Subclass 1.5: Explosives

Consists of very insensitive explosives. This division is comprised of substances which have a mass explosion hazard but are so insensitive that there is very little probability of initiation or of transition from burning to detonation under normal conditions of transport

### Subclass 1.6: Explosives

Consists of extremely insensitive articles which do not have a mass explosive hazard. This division is comprised of articles which contain only extremely insensitive detonating substances and which demonstrate a negligible probability of accidental initiation or propagation

## Class 2: Gases

### Subclass 2.1 - Flammable Gas

454 kg (1001 lbs) of any material which is a gas at 20째C (68째F) or less and 101.3 kPa (14.7 psi) of pressure (a material which has a boiling point of 20째C (68째F) or less at 101.3 kPa (14.7 psi)) which:

1. Is ignitable at 101.3 kPa (14.7 psi) when in a mixture of 13 percent or less by volume with air; or

2. Has a flammable range at 101.3 kPa (14.7 psi) with air of at least 12 percent regardless of the lower limit.
